## Test Section: Python Image Processing

This section is dedicated to testing the use of Python for reading images, detecting the outline of ID documents, and cropping the image if the outline is successfully identified. The goal is to automate the extraction of ID documents from images using computer vision techniques.

**Steps:**

1. Load the image using Python.
2. Apply image processing to detect the ID document outline.
3. If the outline is found, crop the image to the detected region.

This process helps in preparing images for further analysis or storage by focusing only on the relevant document area.
